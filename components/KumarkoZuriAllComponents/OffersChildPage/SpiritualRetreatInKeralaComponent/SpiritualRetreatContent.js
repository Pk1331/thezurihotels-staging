                    <h6 className='text-black'>Temple Visits:</h6>
                    <ul className=''>
                        <li>Vaikom Mahadeva Temple – This temple is one of the few revered by both Shaivas (devotees of Shiva) and Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu). In Vaikom, Shiva is fondly called Vaikkathappan, the lord of Vaikom. The lingam here is believed to be from the Treta Yuga, the second age of Hinduism, and is considered one of the oldest temples in Kerala, where puja has never been interrupted since its inception.</li>
                        <li>Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple – The name “Ettumanoor” originates from the Malayalam words ‘maan’ (deer) and ‘oor’ (place), meaning “the place of deer.” Another interpretation suggests that it comes from ‘Ettu Mana Ooru,’ referring to “The Land of Eight Namboothiri Manas” (Brahmin households). According to temple tradition, the Pandavas and the sage Vyasa worshipped at this temple.</li>
                        <li>Kaduthuruthy Mahadeva Temple – Legend has it that the Shivalinga here was installed by a demon named Khara, who appears in the Ramayana. After worshipping Shiva at Chidambaram, Khara obtained three Shivalingams and carried them—one in each hand and one in his mouth. The one he bit down on was installed here, giving rise to the name Kadichiruthy Prathishitta, which later became Kaduthuruthy. The other two were placed at Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple and Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.</li>
                        <li>Thiruvarppu Sree Krishna Temple – Over 1,500 years old, this temple’s origins are linked to the Mahabharata. It is believed that the idol given to the Pandavas by Krishna for worship during their exile was later placed in the Akshaya Patra and floated into the sea. This is the first temple in India to open its doors each day—it opens at 2:00 AM, performs Abhishekam to Krishna, and first serves Ushapayasam.</li>
                        <li>Thirunakkara Mahadeva Temple – About 500 years old, this temple was built by the Raja of Thekkumkur. It houses unique sculptures and murals of Hindu deities. According to legend, the idol of Shiva here was installed by Parashurama. The Thekkumkur royal family considered the deity their Paradevata (tutelary deity), worshipped as Thirunakkara Thevar.</li>
